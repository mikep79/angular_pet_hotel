# Pet Hotel
Prime group project. CRUD app that allows user to add virtual pets that they can check in for a day at the spa. User first registers a new owner, then selects that owner and fills in data for a pet. The pet can then be checked-in and time-stamped. Focus on SQL join tables and constraints.

Originally written in jQuery, I refactored it to AngularJS. To use jQuery version, go to index.js line 5 and change to index.html (index2.html for Angular).
